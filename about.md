# About MetBot

## Project Overview

MetBot is an AI-powered chatbot designed to revolutionize the car insurance claims process. Traditional claims filing
can be time-consuming, confusing, and frustrating for customers. MetBot aims to simplify this process by providing a
conversational interface that guides users through each step, collects necessary information, and helps identify
potentially fraudulent claims.

## Key Objectives

1. **Simplify the Claims Process**: Transform a complex, form-heavy process into a natural conversation
2. **Reduce Processing Time**: Collect all necessary information efficiently in a single interaction
3. **Enhance Fraud Detection**: Use AI to analyze claim details for potential fraud indicators
4. **Improve Customer Experience**: Provide a modern, accessible interface with multiple input methods
5. **Streamline Documentation**: Allow easy upload and organization of supporting documents

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

MetBot follows a client-server architecture:

- **Backend**: Django with REST Framework for API endpoints
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Bootstrap for responsive design
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini for natural language understanding and generation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for data persistence

### AI Capabilities

The chatbot leverages Google's Gemini AI to:

- Understand natural language input from users
- Extract relevant information from conversations
- Determine when all necessary information has been collected
- Analyze claim details for potential fraud indicators
- Generate natural, contextually appropriate responses

### Data Flow

1. User initiates a conversation
2. AI processes each message to extract claim information
3. Information is stored in structured database models
4. When all information is collected, a fraud analysis is performed
5. A comprehensive claim summary is generated

## Future Enhancements

- **Integration with Claims Systems**: Connect directly to insurance backend systems
- **Mobile Application**: Develop dedicated mobile apps for iOS and Android
- **Enhanced Document Analysis**: Use computer vision to extract information from uploaded documents
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Provide tailored advice based on claim circumstances
